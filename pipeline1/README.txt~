Step 1.

Run pipeline1_trimming_alignment.sh. Input file is *_1.fastq.gz

Usage:
sbatch $HOME/working/SCRIPTS/scripts/pipeline1_trimming_alignment.sh ./fastq/GEO531A1_1.fastq.gz
parallel 'sbatch $HOME/working/SCRIPTS/scripts/pipeline1_trimming_alignment.sh {}' :::  ./fastq/*_1.fastq.gz

Uses Trimmomatic for trimming Illumina paired-end adaptors
Uses Hisat2 for alignment to hg38 human genome

Output 6 folders in the working directory (if they didnt exist before):
bam.files - your bam file
fastQC - quality control files
mapping ang trimmings.logs - info about trimming and alignment
sam.files - should be empty
trimmed.reads - trimmed fastq files


Step 2.

Use when all bam files for the project are generated
Uses gencode v29 basic annoatation for genes and Dfam2 GRCh38.78 annotation for repeats

Usage:
sbatch $HOME/working/SCRIPTS/scripts/pipeline1_counting_reads.sh

Output files with read counts:
raw_TE.counts
raw_gene.counts


Step 3.
Normalize read counts using DESeq2
